# geneticPractice
A toy genetic algorithm program to practice implementation

Based on an exercise given on [ai_junkie](http://www.ai-junkie.com/ga/intro/gat1.html). Given a target number, it attempts to generate an infix equation that matches the number. As part of this, it also implements the shunting algorithm to convert infix expressions to postfix and parse them.

It is currently in a non-working state and unmaintained.
